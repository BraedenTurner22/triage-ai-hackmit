Milestone 1: The Conversational Core (Text-Only)

Focus: Get the brain working before giving it a mouth and ears.

Patient Data Model: In your backend, create a Pydantic model for your Patient object (e.g., name: str | None, age: int | None, urgency_score: float).

LLM Service: Create a Python function get_llm_response(history: list) -> dict. This function will handle the API call to GPT-4o, passing the conversation history and your list of tools (functions).

Function Stubs: Define the Python functions that the LLM can call (e.g., submit_form_data, scan_document). For now, they can just print("Function called!") and return a success message.

Test the Loop: Use your text-only WebSocket to simulate a conversation. Type a message, send it to the backend, have the backend call the LLM, see the LLM choose a function, "execute" the stub, and then generate the next text response. This is the most critical milestone.

Milestone 2: Wiring up Voice (STT & TTS)

Focus: Give the brain a voice and ears.

STT Integration: Modify your frontend to capture microphone audio and stream it through the WebSocket to the backend. The backend will then stream this audio to Deepgram.

TTS Integration: When your backend gets a text response from the LLM, call the ElevenLabs API to generate the audio. Stream this audio data back to the frontend over the WebSocket to be played.

Milestone 3: Integrating Vision (OCR & Passive Analysis)

Focus: Give the brain its eyes.

OCR Endpoint: Create a new HTTP endpoint in FastAPI, e.g., /scan_document.

Triggering the Scan: When the LLM decides to call scan_document, have your backend function send a WebSocket message to the frontend like {"action": "enter_scan_mode"}.

Capture and Send: The frontend will then capture a frame from the camera and POST it to the /scan_document endpoint.

Google Vision Call: The endpoint receives the image, sends it to the Google Vision API, gets the text, and processes it to fill the patient form.

Integrate Existing Models: Connect the outputs of your pre-built heart rate and pain detection models into the main patient data object in the backend.

Milestone 4: The Staff Dashboard

Focus: Create the interface for the nurses.

Basic UI: Build a simple React/Lovable UI that displays a list of patients.

Dashboard WebSocket: Have the dashboard frontend establish its own WebSocket connection to the backend.

Live Updates: Whenever the Patient object is updated on the backend (from the conversation, OCR, or passive analysis), serialize it to JSON and broadcast it over the WebSocket to all connected dashboards. The dashboard UI should then re-render the list, automatically sorting by the new urgency score.

Milestone 5: Final Polish (Last 3-4 Hours)

Urgency Score Logic: Implement the calculate_urgency_score function. This can be a simple weighted sum: score = (pain * 0.4) + (heart_rate_deviation * 0.3) + (is_bleeding_flag * 1.0).

Error Handling & UI: Make it look good. Add loading indicators. Handle cases where the mic doesn't work. Add a manual override on the dashboard.

Practice the Demo: Run through the entire flow multiple times. Prepare your pitch. This is crucial.
